This code suffers from a subtle bug related to how PHP handles type juggling and loose comparison.  The function `checkValue` intends to check if a given value is equal to 1 or '1'. However, due to PHP's loose comparison (`==`), it will return true for various unexpected inputs. For example, an empty string, an array, or even the boolean `false` will result in `true` because they are loosely equal to 0, which is loosely equal to '1'.
